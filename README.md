# small-python-projects

This repo contains some of the smaller project's i've made on the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python bootcamp on udemy. Within this repo you can find a pomodoro timer, a password manager and some other smaller projects that have helped me with concepts like list comprehension and file traversal!
